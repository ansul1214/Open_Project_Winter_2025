# Open_Project_Winter_2025
This repository outlines my Machine learning in quantum tomography assignments week wise and even the final consolidated project repository as of now I have completed the first assignment in which Pauli projective methodology is used for  measurement and later on data is generated for single qubit systems as of now which will be extended to multi-qubit in upcoming week the data are saved in npy form and trace and fiedlity for single qubit are analysed and even visulaisation for the same single qubit is done

Refer to the Original Here[Project Outline](https://jajapuramshivasai.github.io/Open_Project_Winter_2025/) for the detailed schedule, prerequisites, and resource links.
