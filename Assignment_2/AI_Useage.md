AI Tool Used: ChatGPT,Claude

## Usage

- Assistance with GNN architecture structuring
- Cholesky constraint implementation
- Debugging tensor shape issues
- Documentation drafting

## Verification

All AI-generated components were verified by:

- Checking Hermiticity numerically
- Confirming trace(ρ) = 1
- Ensuring eigenvalues ≥ 0
- Validating fidelity and trace distance computations

The final implementation was manually tested and executed.
