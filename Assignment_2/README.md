Track 1: Classical Shadows using Graph Neural Networks

This project reconstructs a 2-qubit density matrix from classical shadow measurements.

## Features

- Graph Neural Network reconstruction
- Physical constraints enforced via Cholesky parameterization
- Fidelity and Trace Distance evaluation
- Inference latency measurement

## Run Instructions

cd src
python train.py

Results will be saved in outputs/
